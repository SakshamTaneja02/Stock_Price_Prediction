We'll start by downloading S&P 500 prices using a package called yfinance.  Then, we'll clean up the data with pandas, and get it ready for machine learning.  
We'll train a random forest model and make predictions using backtesting.  Then, we'll improve the model by adding predictors.
I have also provided the dataset if you do not want to use the yfinance package.
